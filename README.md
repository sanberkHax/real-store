Real Store is an e-commerce website I designed & built for learning purposes. It was originally a simple React test, but then I migrated it to Next.js and completely overhauled it and turned it into a decent portfolio project.

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript
- Next.js (SSG)
- Redux
- React Testing Library
- Fake Store API
